Neurons are pictured in figure 1.2 (top). Neurons consists of three main
parts: the cell body (soma), the branches that transmit the cell’s input from
other neurons (dendrites), and the single trunk transmitting the cell’s output
to other neurons (axon). Very roughly, a neuron can be either in an active state
(firing) or an inactive state (not firing). A neuron fires when it receives enough
signals from other neurons through its dendrites. Firing consists of sending an
electric pulse through the axon, which is then converted into a chemical signal
via chemicals called neurotransmitters. This chemical signal in turn activates
other neurons through their dendrites. The firing frequency and the resulting
chemical output signals of a neuron can vary over time according to both its
input and how much it has been firing recently.
