vim:
r file_name                     #  read the content of a file into the bottom of current file
r !command                      #  read the output of a command and pass it to current file
e.g.
"r !date" can get current time
"r !pwd" can get current directory, so you don't need to leave the file, type pwd, copy it, and back to file again

%s/key_word/target_pattern/gc           # find key_word in current_file( % means current_file) and substitue them with target_pattern
actually, the separate symbol / can be substitute into any other symbol, e.g.

%s!key_word!target_pattern!gc   works well, too.
