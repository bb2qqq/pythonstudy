Why I want to write

Ulysses is unbelievable.

I want to prove that write is a good thing. But soon I find it unneccessary.

I’d like to write, that’s all.

Write is fun.. Especially with such a tool.

It becomes a pleasure.

Now this becomes a great reason why I want to use mac.

It’s just too good. Really.

At past, I can’t understand why people repeat something over and over. 

Now I know why.

There are something that are so good or so bad that overwhelms you. It arouse so much emotion in you. A single word can’t bear all the stuffs. Thus you repeat your words over again. Like I’m going to do right now.

This software is fucking unbelievable.

I’m going to cry.

How could it be so good?

If this is your first time to use Ulysses, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

Before I start writing this piece, I was really confused about my motivation of writing.

Now I know why I wanna write:

Because Ulysses is here
