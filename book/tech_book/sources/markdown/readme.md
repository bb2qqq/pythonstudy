Why I need Markdown?

1. Your docs can be put on web easily, no extra formatting.

2. You can use html language in markdown

3. It can increase (maybe slightly) readability, if you knows its syntax.

Anyway, learn it!









This is my first official markdown file.

I was inspired by Wenchao.Hu. Who makes me understand that this language can facilitate the communications between each others.

I wasn`t write to myself, I am writing to all possible readers.

I am so used to isolate myself. I`ll try to defy this a bit at this moment.
