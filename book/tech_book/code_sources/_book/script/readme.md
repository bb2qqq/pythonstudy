In OSX, when a terminal starts, it reads the config of ~/.bash_profile, instead of ~/.bashrc

To mapping keys on OSX, you had better using some external software, that would be much convinient.

There is a question on stackoverflow, which discussed this, Link:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127591/using-caps-lock-as-esc-in-mac-os-x

In which, the answerer mentioned that, fisrt we need to disable the functionality of Caps in System Preference.

Then we need to downlaod Seil, with this link:  https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en

We enter in Seil after installation, and change CapsLocks`s code value from 57 to 53( Esc code value), and then, in the Other Keys option, change Esc value from 53 to 57. So we got a reverse Key-pair mapping now! Congratulations!
