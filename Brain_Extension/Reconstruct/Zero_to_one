<Chapter 1>     The challenge of the future

There is a good question to predict the future:
"What important truth do very few people agree you on?"
This question is intelectually difficult because all our knowledges taught in school are by definitions agreed upon.
And it's psychologically difficult because we must try say something we know is unpopuler.
Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.
Most answers to this question are different ways of seeing present, good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.

Peter Thiel's answer for this questions is:
"Most people thinks that globalization is the leading force of the future developing, but technology matters more"

My answer to this question is:
"As the technologies develops, most people are becoming more dumb instead of more intelligent, ->                                                       # Zen
because life becomes more convinient, and pleasures are cheaper and more reachable, people will easily be stuck into the mire of comsuptlism,           # Zen
These easy cheap pleasures are good at first, but people will rely on its stimulating effect, and the dose they needed will increased rapidly.          # Zen
And the information flows fast, people's nerves are get used to reciving fast-swift sensational news. They are much more hard to focus on something.    # Zen
But the to master a skill or get some true knowledge requires patient, focus and consistency. These are rare qualities of the people in ourt era.       # Zen
In our era, people are starting a new war counter its own species, In this war, cannons, tanks and bombs are no longer the major role,  ->              # Zen
alluring things targets at the weakness of humanity,    ->                                                                                              # Zen
Such like Tobaccos, alcohols, junk foods(sweets and fried stuffs), porns, electrical games, YY-novels, junky informations, sports videos, ->            # Zen
all kinds of stimulating fast consume informations, they are killing massive people, the new winners of evolution under this enviorment, ->             # Zen
are those who were affect few from these new-era drugs, and mastering the skills to exploit others by using these things.                               # Zen
I am now an engineer in a mobile-game company, thus means a conspiracy of producing electrical drugs,   ->                                              # Zen
but I was also a victim of Porn videos, electrical games, junky informations, sports videos, as I have ADHDs, mixed with some working pressures, ->     # Zen
these stuffs made my life miserable.                                                                                                                    # Zen
Many people believe that: have a big house with swimming pools, with a bunch of bikini beauty queens, infinite BBQs and parties,  ->                    # Zen
sensational electronic equips would be the happiest thing in the world. But it's not, if you have ideas like that and you are now enjoy it, finally     # Zen
you will go for drug, like many popular stars do. The real happiness comes from creation but not comsumption(expecially the irrational kind) ->         # Zen
A creative and peaceful man without too much irrational disires who owns control over his mind and behaviour would enjoy the most of life in our era.   # Zen


Future is a newer world which is different with our current world, but it's based on this World.
If a society didn't change much in 100 years, this scociety didn't experiecen any future in this 100 years.



Globalization and Technology Imrpovement are two demension with not that much influence to each other.
You can expierence both, either or none in a period of time.



Generally, technology is a new and better way to do things, actually, it didn't need to be new to the whole cosmos.
As if it is new to a person, a group of people, a society, it is new relatively.                                                                        # Zen
In the common defination, new technology means new to all human beings.( Who knows our techs are not old-fashioned enough for aliens? )                 # Zen
So, in the globaliztion, developing country exploring new technologies again(old for the developed country).                                            # Zen
It is like a cascade, there are multi-dimensions of world in this planet. They are different in the developing progress.                                # Zen
But for each of them, if they want to improve the productivity and efficiency of their society, they need 'explore' new techs for themselves.           # Zen

< Chapter 2 > Party like it's 1999

If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what hidden behind it: the contrarian truth


The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.
