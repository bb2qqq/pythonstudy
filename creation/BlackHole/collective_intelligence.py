    We believe through interesting compute rules, mass of simple units can behave quite interestingly, so I'm here to experiment with my own thoughts(literal form here).
    The important things is to find the common features of each unit, and using a smart rule to organize it.
    The first thing is to define unit. Was it a letter, a word, a sentence, or a paragraph?
    It's interesting that a letter is meaningless, except it has some phonetic meanings.
    But when several letters were assembled together, it was used to refer to some concept of our life.
    However a single word is too brief, thus words themselves combined into sentence to bear more meanings.
    Words has connections between them, some words can be object/subject of another, and some words are close/opposite.
    A well formed set of words can produce a beautiful form: A decent sentence.
    Sentences as a higher-level unit, can also be combined. The relationship between sentences is that they may intended to revealing something,
    or to present an imaginary graph, sometimes a dinamic graph. The community of sentences is called a paragraph.
    As something are quite complicate, or a picture is grand, we need many paragraphes to do this job.
    Relative paragraphes composed a meaningful entity, if it's short, it is called an article, and if it is long, it forms a book.
    And you can describe the scenary or the principles from another angle, then you can write another book.
    So books talking about similar topics together formed a knowledge system.
    And knowledge system with connections together forms a huger system.
    Until it reach its ultimate: The whole wisdom of the universe.

    But be aware, as an artificial production, books are usually read by an linear order.
    So the words, sentences, paragraphs which are closer usually have stronger correlations
    Though maybe two paragraphs have close relationship, but two arbitrary sentences chosen from them could be totally irrelevant.
    The same thing happens on sentence-word scale. Which means the relationship on higher organizations doesn't affect much about its lower organizations.
    The element of lower organization has sort of independence.
