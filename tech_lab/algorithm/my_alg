Algorithm, I'm coming to you know.


Bascially, algorithm is smart method to solve some kind of problems.
You can combine several method together to solve a particular problem.
There are many classical algorithms. They are just like `+` `-` `*` `/` in arithmatic operations.
All you need is to understand them, and put them into your dailylife usage.
As it requires some kind of thinking. You may want to give up at the beginning.
But, just take it easy, and try understanding what does the methodology do, with your initialality.
