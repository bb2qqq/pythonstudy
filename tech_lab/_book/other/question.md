What's the difference between bit and byte?

    One bit is a 0 or 1.
    And 1 byte equals to 8 bit.
    In IP adresses, when can represent our ip in both bit and byte.
    Like 192.168.0.1 is byte version.
    Meanwhile 11000000  10101000  00000000  00000001 is the bit version.
    As you can see, the number range a byte(8 bit) can represent is 0-255
    ASCII is short for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange", There are 256 symbols in this standard, perfectlly mapping the different status one byte can represent.
    Basically all the keys you can find on your keyboard(U.S.A standard keyboard) are in ASCII.
